Bats tests consitently failed with simple output for all of the create_ files. 
We were unable to pinpoint why this error was happening.
We believe it may been either something with html or possibly sorting of the files.
Other than that no other known errors occurs, and we think the files are mostly operational aside from above error. 
Due to time constraints and lack of ability to pin point error we are turning it in as is.
